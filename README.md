## General Information

My main motivation to create this project was to show up my current experience with coding and try out some new stuff. During the development I learned things like server components, which are React's new feature. They allow people like me (frontend dev) to easily write logic that should only happen on the server, which is really cool. I also learned how to setup Material UI's theme from the ground. User authentication was managed using Clerk and Next's middleware. Zustand turned out to be my new favourite global state management library because of it's simplicity and lightness. Nuqs really helped me with managing the URL state when dealing with paginated table.
